block.supermod-blighted-breach.description = Infested by the blight. Otherwise identical to a breach.

block.supermod-warp-driver.name = Warp Driver
block.supermod-warp-driver.description = Launches items towards other warp drivers. Must be supplied with phase energy for operation.
block.supermod-warp-driver.details = By marking payloads of items with a special temporal frequency, cargo can be concealed and hidden from view.

block.supermod-phasefoam-synthesizer.name = Phasefoam Synthesizer
block.supermod-phasefoam-synthesizer.description = Provides a protective dome for cryofluid and arkycite to react, producing phasefoam in the process.
block.supermod-inertial-phase-disentangler.name = Inertial Phase Disentangler
block.supermod-inertial-phase-disentangler.description = Disentangles quantum knots inside phasefoam using phase fabric as a catalyst. Produces scrap as a byproduct.

block.supermod-soldier-reassembler.name = Soldier Reassembler
block.supermod-soldier-reassembler.description = Assembles soldier units using payload input. Output tier may be increased by adding modules.
block.supermod-soldier-reassembler.details = By supplying assembled units with stores of phase energy, said units can manipulate physics in novel ways.
block.supermod-primary-reassembler-module.name = Primary Reassembler Module

block.supermod-primary-reassembler-module.details = The use of phase energy allows for machines to be miniaturized, aiding in the construction of large units.

unit.supermod-urge.name = Urge
unit.supermod-urge.description = Fires powerful shotguns at nearby targets. Harnesses internal phase energy stores to teleport medium distances after a brief period of charging.
unit.supermod-urge.details = Built to weave in and out of Malis fortifications, the Urge is capable of teleporting in and out of battle. Its predecessor, the Switchblade, synthesized its phase energy on-site. Not only was this a slow and inefficient process, damage sustained in battle could disable its teleportation capabilities.
unit.supermod-exhort.name = Exhort
unit.supermod-exhort.description = Fires concentrated flames at nearby targets. Harnesses internal phase energy stores to overdrive its maintenance mechanisms, rendering it capable of limited self-repair.
unit.supermod-exhort.details = Built in pursuit of a sustainable solution against the Blight, the Exhort is capable of limited self-repair.
